# minimal_poseidon

This is a minimal implementation of Poseidon permutation function for usage in orchard crate.

The purpose of this crate is to have a no_std-supporting Poseidon crate,
before halo2_gadgets will be separated reasonably and in will be ready
for contributions. I need such a crate for development of Orchard transactions
for Trezor T.
